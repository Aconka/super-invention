Humanity was shocked when tell# ,where # is literally any number you can think of, released early beta screen shots of his latest and greatest computational tool. This would lead him to a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. This humble project hopes to recreate the experience of this life changing application on a mobile platform for use in an educational environment. We hope that this port will bring the huge computing potential of  tellâ€™s software to a wider audience. And more importantly get me a Nobel Peace Prize for porting such a complex application to a platform with extremely modest specs.
